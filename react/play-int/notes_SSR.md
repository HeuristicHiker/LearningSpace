# RSC
- Only every renders from server
- A React server component is a component that only renders on the server.
- After page load, directly gets component from server rather than bundle
- Less JS run on client
- Next.js assumes server component by default unless stated explicity
- useState not on SSR/ RSC since client side

# SSR
- Can have ongoing client changes after that take over

# Auth
- [Auth provider option](https://neon.tech/)
